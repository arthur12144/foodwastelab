            <p class="description">I provide consulting services for grocery retailers to reduce shrink and improve inventory health, and for technology companies to ensure their software is optimized for the real world.  I use extreme data deep dives and in-person gemba walks to deliver step change shrink reduction approaches.</p>

                <p class="bio">I am a food waste nerd, with an extremely deep background in food supply chain and the use of technology and data to reduce waste. 
                    <br><br> 
                    I was previously at Amazon for 7 years, most recently leading a team of technical product managers with the Amazon Grocery tech team where I was responsible for delivering and improving industry-leading grocery inventory control and health software. 
                    <br><br>
                    I also led the team that built and scaled the Amazon Fresh perishable supply chain (including Whole Foods technical and non-technical integration), and led the Instock team for Produce, Meat, and Fish for Amazon Fresh for 2 years, which taught me very tangibly how to build optimal safety stock strategies while the business was growing 4x. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Prior to Amazon, I had a varied career including helping to scale two food startups, leading sustainability work for Ford and Boeing, setting up community agriculture classes in Tanzania, and various other work. I also have both an MBA and Masters in Environmental Science from the University of Michigan where I was a fellow at the Erb Institute. 
                    <br><br> 
                    In addition to being an independent consultant, I am also an entrepreneur. I live on Bainbridge Island (outside Seattle) with my wife, two kids, two dogs, and seven chickens.</p>
